# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges, written
in **Go**. However, they may not be the most concise nor the most optimized.

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lezurex/advent-of-code24.git
   cd advent-of-code24
   ```

2. Prepare your input files:
    - Place your inputs in the `inputs/` directory.
    - Name them as `dayXX.txt` (e.g., `day01.txt` for Day 1).

3. Run a solution:
    - Open `main.go` and set the `day` variable to the desired day.
    - Run the program:
      ```bash
      go run main.go
      ```

Happy coding! ðŸŽ…
